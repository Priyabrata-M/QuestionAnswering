Your eyes get red when the tiny blood vessels on the surface of the eyes expand and turn the whites of one or both eyes a pink or reddish tint. Many things can cause it, like a night of heavy drinking, or a physical injury to your eye. But if you havenâ€™t had too much alcohol, or scratched or poked your eyeball recently, there are other possibilities.

Allergy triggers may make your eyes red. Outdoor causes include pollen from grasses and trees. Indoor triggers include pet dander, dust or mold, or irritants like perfume and smoke. In these cases, your eyes may also have:

Itching
Burning
Tearing
You may also have nasal allergy symptoms, such as sneezing and a stuffy nose.
