Baby colic, also known as infantile colic, is defined as episodes of crying for more than three hours a day, for more than three days a week, for three weeks in an otherwise healthy child.[1] Often crying occurs in the evening.[1] It typically does not result in long term problems.[4] The crying can cause frustration for the parents, depression following delivery, excess visits to the doctor, and child abuse.[1]

The cause of colic is unknown.[1] Some believe it is due to gastrointestinal discomfort like intestinal cramping.[5] Diagnosis requires ruling out other possible causes.[1] Concerning findings include a fever, poor activity, or a swollen abdomen.[1] Fewer than 5% of infants with excess crying have an underlying organic disease.[1]

Treatment is generally conservative, with little to no role for either medications or alternative therapies.[3] Extra support for the parents may be useful.[1] Tentative evidence supports certain probiotics for the baby and a low-allergen diet by the mother in those who are breastfed.[1] Hydrolyzed formula may be useful in those who are bottlefed.[1]

Colic affects 10â€“40% of children.[1] It is most common at six weeks of age and typically goes away by six months of age.[1] It rarely lasts up to one year of age.[6] It occurs at the same rate in boys and in girls.[1] The first detailed medical description of the problem occurred in 1954.[7]


Colic is defined as episodes of crying for more than three hours a day, for more than three days a week for a three-week duration in an otherwise healthy child between the ages of two weeks and four months.[8] By contrast, infants normally cry an average of just over two hours a day, with the duration peaking at six weeks.[9] With colic, periods of crying most commonly happen in the evening and for no obvious reason.[1] Associated symptoms may include legs pulled up to the stomach, a flushed face, clenched hands, and a wrinkled brow.[9] The cry is often high pitched (piercing).[9]
