Epigastric pain is a name for pain or discomfort right below your ribs in the area of your upper abdomen. It often happens alongside other common symptoms of your digestive system. These symptoms can include heartburn, bloating, and gas.

Epigastric pain isn’t always cause for concern. This condition has many possible causes, especially when it happens right after eating.

It’s important to be able to tell the difference between pain that’s a result of something harmless, like overeating or lactose intolerance, and pain that happens because of an underlying condition, such as GERD, inflammation, or infection.
