Night sweats, or excessive sweating during sleep, are a common symptom in women and men. There are many medical conditions and diseases that cause them. Examples include women in perimenopause or menopause; medications, hormone problems (Low-T), low blood sugar, and neurological problems. You may have other symptoms like chills, or shaking with a fever, vaginal dryness, or mood changes, depending upon the cause. Less common causes of night sweats include infections and cancers. Doctors treat the problem by diagnosing the cause of your night sweats.
