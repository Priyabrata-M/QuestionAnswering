Conjunctivitis, also known as pink eye, is inflammation of the outermost layer of the white part of the eye and the inner surface of the eyelid.[3] It makes the eye appear pink or reddish.[1] There may also be pain, burning, scratchiness, or itchiness.[1] The affected eye may have increased tears or be "stuck shut" in the morning.[1] Swelling of the white part of the eye may also occur.[1] Itching of the eye is more common in cases due to allergies.[2] Conjunctivitis can affect one or both eyes.[1]

The most common infectious causes are viral followed by bacterial.[2] The viral infection may occur along with other symptoms of a common cold.[1] Viral and bacterial cases are easily spread between people.[1] Allergies to pollen or animal hair is also a common cause.[2] Diagnosis is often based on signs and symptoms.[1] Occasionally a sample of the discharge is sent for culture.[1]

Prevention is partly by handwashing.[1] Treatment depends on the underlying cause.[1] In the majority of viral cases, there is no specific treatment.[2] Most cases due to a bacterial infection will also resolve without treatment; however, antibiotics can shorten the illness.[1][2] Those who wear contact lens and those with either gonorrhea or chlamydia as the cause should be treated.[2] Allergic cases can be treated with antihistamine or mast cell inhibitor drops.[2]

About 3 to 6 million people get conjunctivitis each year in the United States.[1][2] In adults viral causes are more common, while in children bacterial causes are more common.[2] Typically people get better in one or two weeks.[1][2] If there is visual loss, significant pain, sensitivity to light, signs of herpes, or a person is not improving after a week, further diagnosis and treatment may be required.[2] Conjunctivitis in a newborn, known as neonatal conjunctivitis, may also require specific treatment.[1]

Red eye, swelling of conjunctiva and watering of the eyes are symptoms common to all forms of conjunctivitis. However, the pupils should be normally reactive, and the visual acuity normal.
