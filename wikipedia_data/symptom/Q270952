The common cold, also known simply as a cold, is a viral infectious disease of the upper respiratory tract that primarily affects the nose.[7] The throat, sinuses, and larynx may also be affected.[5] Signs and symptoms may appear less than two days after exposure to the virus.[5] These may include coughing, sore throat, runny nose, sneezing, headache, and fever.[2][3] People usually recover in seven to ten days,[2] but some symptoms may last up to three weeks.[6] Occasionally those with other health problems may develop pneumonia.[2]

Well over 200 virus strains are implicated in causing the common cold, with rhinoviruses being the most common.[11] They spread through the air during close contact with infected people or indirectly through contact with objects in the environment, followed by transfer to the mouth or nose.[2] Risk factors include going to daycare, not sleeping well, and psychological stress.[5] The symptoms are mostly due to the body's immune response to the infection rather than to tissue destruction by the viruses themselves.[12] In contrast, those affected by influenza can show similar symptoms as people with a cold, but symptoms are usually more severe.[5] Additionally, the influenza is less likely to result in a runny nose.[13]

There is no vaccine for the common cold.[2] The primary methods of prevention are: hand washing; not touching the eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands; and staying away from sick people.[2] Some evidence supports the use of face masks.[14] There is also no cure, but the symptoms can be treated.[2] Zinc may reduce the duration and severity of symptoms if started shortly after the onset of symptoms.[8] Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen may help with pain.[9] Antibiotics, however, should not be used[15] and there is no evidence for cough medicines.[5]

The common cold is the most frequent infectious disease in humans.[16] The average adult gets two to three colds a year, while the average child may get six to eight.[10][7] Infections occur more commonly during the winter.[2] These infections have existed throughout human history.[17]
