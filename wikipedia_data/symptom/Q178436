Constipation refers to bowel movements that are infrequent or hard to pass.[2] The stool is often hard and dry.[4] Other symptoms may include abdominal pain, bloating, and feeling as if one has not completely passed the bowel movement.[3] Complications from constipation may include hemorrhoids, anal fissure or fecal impaction.[4] The normal frequency of bowel movements in adults is between three per day and three per week.[4] Babies often have three to four bowel movements per day while young children typically have two to three per day.[8]

Constipation has many causes.[4] Common causes include slow movement of stool within the colon, irritable bowel syndrome, and pelvic floor disorders.[4] Underlying associated diseases include hypothyroidism, diabetes, Parkinson's disease, celiac disease, non-celiac gluten sensitivity, colon cancer, diverticulitis, and inflammatory bowel disease.[4][9][5][6] Medications associated with constipation include opioids, certain antacids, calcium channel blockers, and anticholinergics.[4] Of those taking opioids about 90% develop constipation.[10] Constipation is more concerning when there is weight loss or anemia, blood is present in the stool, there is a history of inflammatory bowel disease or colon cancer in a person's family, or it is of new onset in someone who is older.[11]

Treatment of constipation depends on the underlying cause and the duration that it has been present.[4] Measures that may help include drinking enough fluids, eating more fiber, and exercise.[4] If this is not effective, laxatives of the bulk forming agent, osmotic agent, stool softener, or lubricant type may be recommended.[4] Stimulant laxatives are generally reserved for when other types are not effective.[4] Other treatments may include biofeedback or in rare cases surgery.[4]

In the general population rates of constipation are 2–30 percent.[7] Among elderly people living in a care home the rate of constipation is 50–75 percent.[10] People spend, in the United States, more than US$250 million on medications for constipation a year.[12]
