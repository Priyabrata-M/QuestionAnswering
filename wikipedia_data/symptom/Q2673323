Malaise is a feeling of general discomfort, uneasiness or pain, often the first indication of an infection or other disease.[1][2] The word has existed in the French language since at least the 12th century.

The term is also often used figuratively in other contexts; for example, "economic malaise" refers to an economy that is stagnant or in recession (compare depression). The term is particularly associated with the US 1973â€“75 recession.[3] A speech made by President Jimmy Carter in 1979 is commonly referred to as the "malaise" speech, although the term was not in the speech.
