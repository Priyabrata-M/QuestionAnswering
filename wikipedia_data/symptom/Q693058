Chest pain is pain in any region of the chest. Chest pain may be a symptom of a number of serious disorders and is, in general, considered a medical emergency. Chest pain can be differentiated into heart-related and non heart related chest pain.[1][2][3] Cardiac chest pain is called angina pectoris. Some causes of noncardiac chest pain include gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal, or lung issues.[4] Even though chest pain may not be related to a heart problem, noncardiac chest pain can still be due to significant disease.[3] Chest pain can present with different types of pain and associated symptoms which may vary with a person's age, sex, and previous medical conditions.[1] Determining the cause of chest pain is through review of a person's medical history, a physical exam, and other medical tests.[1][4] Management of chest pain is based on the underlying cause.[1][4]

Chest pain is a common presenting problem:

In the United States, an estimated 6-8 million people per year present to the emergency department with chest pain.[4][1]
An estimated 50-70% of patients presenting with chest pain in the emergency department will be placed in an observation unit or admitted to the hospital.[1]
2 million people are admitted annually for workup of acute coronary syndrome (ACS).[5]
Approximately 8 billion dollars are used annually to evaluate complaints of chest pain.[3]
Children with chest pain account for 0.3% to 0.6% of pediatric emergency department visits.[6]
