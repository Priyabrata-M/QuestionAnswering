Strawberry tongue is the name given to a swollen, bumpy tongue. Most often, the enlarged tongue is very red, like a strawberry or raspberry. Occasionally, the tongue will be white for a few days before turning red.

Strawberry tongue isnâ€™t itself a condition. A red, bumpy tongue with enlarged taste buds are symptoms of an underlying condition or disorder. Diagnosing and treating the condition or disorder will revert your tongue to its usual appearance.
