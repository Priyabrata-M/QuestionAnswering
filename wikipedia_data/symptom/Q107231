Paralysis is a loss of muscle function for one or more muscles. Paralysis can be accompanied by a loss of feeling (sensory loss) in the affected area if there is sensory damage as well as motor. About 1 in 50 people in the U.S. have been diagnosed with some form of paralysis, transient or permanent.[1] The word comes from the Greek "disabling of the nerves",[2] itself from (para), "beside, by"[3] and (lysis), "losing"[4] and that from λύω (luō), "to lose".[5] A paralysis accompanied by involuntary tremors is usually called "palsy".[6][7]
