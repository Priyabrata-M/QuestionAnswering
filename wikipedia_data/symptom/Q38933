Fever, also known as pyrexia and febrile response,[6] is defined as having a temperature above the normal range due to an increase in the body's temperature set-point.[4][5] There is not a single agreed-upon upper limit for normal temperature with sources using values between 37.5 and 38.3 째C (99.5 and 100.9 째F).[6][7] The increase in set-point triggers increased muscle contractions and causes a feeling of cold.[1] This results in greater heat production and efforts to conserve heat.[2] When the set-point temperature returns to normal, a person feels hot, becomes flushed, and may begin to sweat.[2] Rarely a fever may trigger a febrile seizure.[3] This is more common in young children.[3] Fevers do not typically go higher than 41 to 42 째C (105.8 to 107.6 째F).[5]

A fever can be caused by many medical conditions ranging from non serious to life threatening.[11] This includes viral, bacterial and parasitic infections such as the common cold, urinary tract infections, meningitis, malaria and appendicitis among others.[11] Non-infectious causes include vasculitis, deep vein thrombosis, side effects of medication, and cancer among others.[11] It differs from hyperthermia, in that hyperthermia is an increase in body temperature over the temperature set-point, due to either too much heat production or not enough heat loss.[6]

Treatment to reduce fever is generally not required.[1][8] Treatment of associated pain and inflammation, however, may be useful and help a person rest.[8] Medications such as ibuprofen or paracetamol (acetaminophen) may help with this as well as lower temperature.[8][9] Measures such as putting a cool damp cloth on the forehead and having a slightly warm bath are not useful and may simply make a person more uncomfortable.[8] Children younger than three months require medical attention, as might people with serious medical problems such as a compromised immune system or people with other symptoms.[12] Hyperthermia does require treatment.[1]

Fever is one of the most common medical signs.[1] It is part of about 30% of healthcare visits by children[1] and occurs in up to 75% of adults who are seriously sick.[10] While fever is a useful defense mechanism, treating fever does not appear to worsen outcomes.[13][14] Fever is viewed with greater concern by parents and healthcare professionals than it usually deserves, a phenomenon known as fever phobia.[1]

A fever is usually accompanied by sickness behavior, which consists of lethargy, depression, anorexia, sleepiness, hyperalgesia, and the inability to concentrate.[35][36][37]
