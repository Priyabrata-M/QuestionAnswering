Meningism, also called meningismus[1][2] is a set of symptoms caused by irritation of the meninges. This may be due to meningitis (inflammation of the meninges), or subarachnoid haemorrhage. Meningism involves the triad (3-symptom syndrome) of nuchal rigidity (neck stiffness), photophobia (intolerance of bright light), and headache. It requires differentiating from other problems with similar symptoms, including Parkinson's Disease and Cervical Spondylosis. Related clinical signs include Kernig's sign and three signs all named Brudzinski's sign.

The main clinical signs that indicate meningism are nuchal rigidity, Kernig's sign and Brudzinski's signs. None of the signs are particularly sensitive; in adults with meningitis, nuchal rigidity was present in 30% and Kernig's or Brudzinski's sign only in 5%.[3]
