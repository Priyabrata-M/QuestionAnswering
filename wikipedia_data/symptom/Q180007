Syncope, also known as fainting, is a loss of consciousness and muscle strength characterized by a fast onset, short duration, and spontaneous recovery.[1] It is caused by a decrease in blood flow to the brain, usually from low blood pressure.[1] There are sometimes symptoms before the loss of consciousness such as lightheadedness, sweating, pale skin, blurred vision, nausea, vomiting, or feeling warm. Syncope may also be associated with a short episode of muscle twitching.[1] When consciousness and muscle strength are not completely lost, it is called presyncope.[1] It is recommended that presyncope be treated the same as syncope.[1]

Causes range from non-serious to potentially fatal.[1] There are three broad categories of causes: heart or blood vessel related, reflex also known as neurally mediated, and orthostatic hypotension.[1] Issues with the heart and blood vessels are the cause in about 10% and typically the most serious while neurally mediated is the most common.[1] Heart related causes may include an abnormal heart rhythm, problems with the heart valves or heart muscle and blockages of blood vessels from a pulmonary embolism or aortic dissection among others.[1] Neurally mediated syncope occurs when blood vessels expand and heart rate decreases inappropriately.[1] This may occur from either a triggering event such as exposure to blood, pain, strong feelings or a specific activity such as urination, vomiting, or coughing.[1] This type of syncope may also occur when an area in the neck known as the carotid sinus is pressed.[1] The final type of syncope is due to a drop in blood pressure from standing up.[1] This is often due to medications that a person is taking but may also be related to dehydration, significant bleeding or infection.[1]

A medical history, physical examination, and electrocardiogram (ECG) are the most effective ways to figure out the underlying cause.[1] The ECG is useful to detect an abnormal heart rhythm, poor blood flow to the heart muscle, and other electrical issue such as long QT syndrome and Brugada syndrome.[1] Heart related causes also often have little history of a prodrome.[1] Low blood pressure and a fast heart rate after the event may indicate blood loss or dehydration, while low blood oxygen levels may be seen following the event in those with pulmonary embolism.[1] More specific tests such as implantable loop recorders, tilt table testing or carotid sinus massage may be useful in uncertain cases.[1] Computed tomography (CT) is generally not required unless specific concerns are present.[1] Other causes of similar symptoms that should be considered include seizure, stroke, concussion, low blood oxygen, low blood sugar, drug intoxication and some psychiatric disorders among others.[1] Treatment depends on the underlying cause.[1] Those who are considered at high risk following investigation may be admitted to hospital for further monitoring of the heart.[1]

Syncope affects about three to six out of every thousand people each year.[1] It is more common in older people and females.[3] It is the reason for one to three percent of visits to emergency departments and admissions to hospital.[3] Up to half of women over the age of 80 and a third of medical students describe at least one event at some point in their life.[3] Of those presenting with syncope to an emergency department, about 4% died in the next 30 days.[1] The risk of a poor outcome, however, depends very much on the underlying cause.[2]
