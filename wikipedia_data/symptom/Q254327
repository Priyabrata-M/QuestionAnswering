Anorexia nervosa, often referred to simply as anorexia,[11] is an eating disorder characterized by low weight, fear of gaining weight, and a strong desire to be thin, resulting in food restriction.[1] Many people with anorexia see themselves as overweight even though they are in fact underweight.[1][2] If asked they usually deny they have a problem with low weight.[3] Often they weigh themselves frequently, eat only small amounts, and only eat certain foods.[1] Individuals with anorexia will limit the number of calories taken in daily and restrict the types of food they intake.[12] Some will exercise excessively, force themselves to vomit, or use laxatives to produce weight loss.[1] These people will also have trouble maintaining a “normal’” weight for their height, age, and/or stature. [13]Complications may include osteoporosis, infertility and heart damage, among others.[1] Women will often stop having menstrual periods.[3]Victims of anorexia limit the number of calories taken in daily and restrict the types of food they intake.

The cause is not known.[2] There appear to be some genetic components with identical twins more often affected than non-identical twins.[2] Cultural factors also appear to play a role with societies that value thinness having higher rates of disease.[3] Additionally, it occurs more commonly among those involved in activities that value thinness such as high-level athletics, modelling, and dancing.[3][4] Anorexia often begins following a major life-change or stress-inducing event.[3] The diagnosis requires a significantly low weight.[3] The severity of disease is based on body mass index (BMI) in adults with mild disease having a BMI of greater than 17, moderate a BMI of 16 to 17, severe a BMI of 15 to 16, and extreme a BMI less than 15.[3] In children a BMI for age percentile of less than the 5th percentile is often used.[3]

Treatment of anorexia involves restoring a healthy weight, treating the underlying psychological problems, and addressing behaviors that promote the problem.[1] While medications do not help with weight gain, they may be used to help with associated anxiety or depression.[1] A number of types of therapy may be useful including an approach where parents assume responsibility for feeding their child, known as Maudsley family therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy.[1][14] Sometimes people require admission to hospital to restore weight.[7] Evidence for benefit from nasogastric tube feeding, however, is unclear.[15] Some people will just have a single episode and recover while others may have many episodes over years.[7] Many complications improve or resolve with regaining of weight.[7]

Globally, anorexia is estimated to affect 2.9 million people as of 2015.[9] It is estimated to occur in 0.9% to 4.3% of women and 0.2% to 0.3% of men in Western countries at some point in their life.[16] About 0.4% of young women are affected in a given year and it is estimated to occur ten times less commonly in men.[3][16] Rates in most of the developing world are unclear.[3] Often it begins during the teen years or young adulthood.[1] While anorexia became more commonly diagnosed during the 20th century it is unclear if this was due to an increase in its frequency or simply better diagnosis.[2] In 2013 it directly resulted in about 600 deaths globally, up from 400 deaths in 1990.[17] Eating disorders also increase a person's risk of death from a wide range of other causes, including suicide.[1][16] About 5% of people with anorexia die from complications over a ten-year period, a nearly 6 times increased risk.[3][8] The term anorexia nervosa was first used in 1873 by William Gull to describe this condition.[18]


Anorexia nervosa is an eating disorder characterized by attempts to lose weight, to the point of starvation. A person with anorexia nervosa may exhibit a number of signs and symptoms, the type and severity of which may vary and may be present but not readily apparent.[19]

Anorexia nervosa, and the associated malnutrition that results from self-imposed starvation, can cause complications in every major organ system in the body.[20] Hypokalaemia, a drop in the level of potassium in the blood, is a sign of anorexia nervosa.[21][22] A significant drop in potassium can cause abnormal heart rhythms, constipation, fatigue, muscle damage and paralysis.[23]

Symptoms may include:

A low body mass index for one's age and height.
Amenorrhea, a symptom that occurs after prolonged weight loss; causes menstruation to stop, hair becomes brittle, and skin becomes yellow and unhealthy.
Fear of even the slightest weight gain; taking all precautionary measures to avoid weight gain or becoming "overweight".[24]
Rapid, continuous weight loss.[25]
Lanugo: soft, fine hair growing over the face and body.[22]
An obsession with counting calories and monitoring fat contents of food.
Preoccupation with food, recipes, or cooking; may cook elaborate dinners for others, but not eat the food themselves or consume a very small portion.
Food restrictions despite being underweight or at a healthy weight.
Food rituals, such as cutting food into tiny pieces, refusing to eat around others and hiding or discarding of food.
Purging: May use laxatives, diet pills, ipecac syrup, or water pills to flush food out of their system after eating or may engage in self-induced vomiting though this is a more common symptom of bulimia.
Excessive exercise[26] including micro-exercising, for example making small persistent movements of fingers or toes.[27]
Perception of self as overweight, in contradiction to an underweight reality.
Intolerance to cold and frequent complaints of being cold; body temperature may lower (hypothermia) in an effort to conserve energy due to malnutrition.[28]
Hypotension or orthostatic hypotension.
Bradycardia or tachycardia.
Depression, anxiety disorders and insomnia.
Solitude: may avoid friends and family and become more withdrawn and secretive.
Abdominal distension.
Halitosis (from vomiting or starvation-induced ketosis).
Dry hair and skin, as well as hair thinning.
Chronic fatigue.[24]
Rapid mood swings.
Having feet discoloration causing an orange appearance.
Having severe muscle tension + aches and pains.
Evidence/habits of self harming or self-loathing.
