Clonus (from the Greek for "violent, confused motion") is a series of involuntary, rhythmic, muscular contractions and relaxations. Clonus is a sign of certain neurological conditions, particularly associated with upper motor neuron lesions involving descending motor pathways, and in many cases is, accompanied by spasticity (another form of hyperexcitability).[1] Unlike small, spontaneous twitches known as fasciculations (usually caused by lower motor neuron pathology), clonus causes large motions that are usually initiated by a reflex. Studies have shown clonus beat frequency to range from three to eight Hz on average, and may last a few seconds to several minutes depending on the patientâ€™s condition.[1]


Clonus is most commonly found at the ankle, specifically with a dorsiflexion/plantarflexion movement (up and down).[2] Some case studies have also reported clonus in the finger, toe, and laterally in the ankle (as opposed to the typical up and down motion).[3][4]
