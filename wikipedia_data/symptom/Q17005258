Clouding of consciousness, also known as brain fog or mental fog,[1][2] is a term used in medicine denoting an abnormality in the regulation of the overall level of consciousness that is mild and less severe than a delirium.[3] The sufferer experiences a subjective sensation of mental clouding described as feeling "foggy".[4]
