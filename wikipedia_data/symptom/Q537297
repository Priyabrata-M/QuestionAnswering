Heartburn is a feeling of burning in your chest, and is a symptom of acid reflux or GERD.
Heartburn is most common after meals, but can also awaken people while they are sleeping.
People also may experience heartburn after eating specific foods or drinking certain beverages.
Symptoms of acid reflux that may accompany heartburn include:
difficulty swallowing,
chronic cough,
stomach pain or burning in the upper abdomen,
persistent sore throat,

Diet and other lifestyle changes can alleviate heartburn for many people.
