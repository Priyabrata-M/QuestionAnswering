The diarrhea is often quite watery, and the volume defecated may be more voluminous than normal. Others have an urgency to defecate, and strain while doing so. Many pet parents describe the feces as pure blood. Patients often have concurrent vomiting (sometimes with blood in it) and reduced appetites. They are quite lethargic, may have abdominal discomfort, and are frequently dehydrated because of fluid loss through diarrhea.
