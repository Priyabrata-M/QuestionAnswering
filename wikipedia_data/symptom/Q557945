Delirium is a cognitive impairment disorder, meaning that it affects how a person thinks, remembers, and reasons. The main signs are sudden changes in consciousness or state of arousal, such as feeling drowsy or agitated.

A person with delirium may experience confusion, disorientation, an inability to focus, memory problems, or changes in perception. These can include hallucinations or experiencing events that aren’t really happening.

Delirium is the most common sign of medical complications of cancer or cancer treatment affecting the brain and mind. It is a common problem for people with advanced cancer or those at the end of life. Because of its troubling symptoms, delirium is often very stressful for the patient and family members.

In addition, delirium complicates the ability of the health care staff to assess and manage a person’s other symptoms. It can also interfere with a patient’s ability to receive cancer treatments.
